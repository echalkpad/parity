Parity Stock Ticker
===================

Parity Stock Ticker is a simple console application that displays the best
bids and offers (BBOs) and latest trades in Parity Trading System.


Usage
-----

Run Parity Stock Ticker with Java:

    java -jar <executable> <command>

To listen to a live market data feed, use the `listen` command:

    java -jar <executable> listen [-t] <configuration-file>

When listening to a live market data feed, the stock ticker first replays
market events that have taken place before it started. Then it proceeds to
display market events in real time.

By default, the stock ticker formats its output for display. If the `-t`
option is given, it formats the output as [TAQ][] instead.
